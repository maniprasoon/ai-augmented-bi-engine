# AI-Augmented Business Intelligence & Decision Analytics Engine

An end-to-end analytics system that transforms raw transactional data into **executive-ready insights** by combining **Python analytics, Gemini LLMs, and Power BI**.  
The project focuses on explaining **what changed, why it changed, and what actions to take**, not just reporting metrics.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional dashboards show *what* happened.  
This system goes further by automatically identifying **root causes of change** and generating **plain-English business explanations** for decision-makers.

**Key outcomes:**
- Automated KPI generation
- Root-cause analysis for revenue changes
- AI-generated executive summaries
- Decision-focused Power BI dashboards

## 🧠 Architecture

**Decision-Driven Analytics Pipeline**

Olist Transactional Data (CSV)  
→ Python (Data Cleaning, KPI Computation, Change Detection)  
→ Gemini LLM (Executive Insights & Recommendations)  
→ Power BI (Decision-Focused Dashboards)

This architecture is designed to move beyond static reporting and enable
**explainable, action-oriented business intelligence**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Google Gemini API** (LLM-based business insights)
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **CSV-based transactional datasets (Olist)**

## 📊 Data Sources

This project uses a real-world Brazilian e-commerce dataset (Olist), including:
- Orders
- Order items (revenue & freight)
- Payments
- Customers (geographic attribution)

These datasets simulate a **production-grade business environment** with multi-table joins.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Unified Master Table**  
  Joined orders, items, payments, and customers into a single business-ready fact table.

- **KPI Engine**  
  Automatically computes revenue, growth, order value, and operational efficiency metrics.

- **Change Detection & Root Cause Analysis**  
  Identifies which regions contributed most to revenue changes using optimized order-level aggregation.

- **AI-Generated Executive Insights**  
  Uses Gemini LLM to explain:
  - What changed  
  - Why it changed  
  - Business risks  
  - Recommended actions  

- **Power BI Decision Dashboard**  
  Visualizes KPIs, trends, and root causes with an executive-first design.
